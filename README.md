Indonesia's 2014 presidential elections were a landmark in the country's history, being the most closely contested election since independence in 1945 (and the most closely contested *presidential election* since direct elections were first held in 2004). While some maps of election results at the provincial (*propinsi*) level are available [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_presidential_election,_2014#/media/File:2014IndonesianPresidentialElectionMap.png), maps of the results of elections at the regency (*kabupaten*) and distict (*kecamatan*) level are not. (**Edit:** As of Jan 8 2016, [Felix Halim](http://felix-halim.net/kp.html) has a map down to the district level). Using results available from [KawalPemilu](http://kawalpemilu.org/#0), we seek to produce a map of Indonesian elections to demonstrate the variation in levels of support in different parts of the country.
